            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I muſt expect the ſottiſh Malignant cenſures of <hi>Zoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> and <hi>Momus,</hi> and ſuch fools: but the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his Prologue in the enſuing diſcourſe, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleares all objections, and therefore I ſhall ſave that labour; onely I would have ſuch men not be ſo wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant, as altogether to forget, that the Heavens declare the glory of God, and the Firmament ſheweth his handy-worke.

            </p>
            <p>It is the General opinion of moſt ignorant people, to count all things that are above their Vulgar appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, to be diabolicall, and meerly brought to paſs by the works of the Devil: and under that notion they conclude all the ſecret and Magnetick operations of nature, and thereby rob God the creator of all things, of that glory that is due unto him onely, and attribute the ſame to the Devil the enemy to God and all the world: I ſhall therefore here take occaſion to tell ſuch people (becauſe their Prieſts, that ſhould teach them knowledge, either cannot or elſe will not) what the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is. As in the Microcoſmus or little world Man, the Soul is the beſt part, and the excrements the worſt; ſo in the great world, as the Univerſal creating ſpirit is the beſt part, ſo is the Devil the excrement of that Univerſal Spirit, and the abject and <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> of the world; and the pooreſt and moſt wretched of all created beings: And that worketh a great Antipathy between him and us, and the bleſſed holy Angels, who are our Governors and Protectors, and continual guardians, and are continually employed about us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their orders and miniſteries appointed them by the moſt High: although the Devil alwayes endeavoureth to imitate and counterfeit the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and thereby deceiveth many whoſe wickedneſs and malice ſuits with his nature, and at which the good Angel being grieved, leaves them; and many times for the wickedneſs of ſome Perſon or Family, the
<pb facs="tcp:170095:6"/>
good Angel curſes ſuch a perſon and family, or houſe; then the wicked Spirit haunts ſuch houſes, affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people with many fearful apparitions; neither can that houſe be quiet, nor any ſuch perſon; neither ſhall any of the Generation of any ſuch family proſper untill that curſe be expiated, and the angry Angel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed; as this Author will tell you, and woful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience daily ſhews: how frequently, and familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did thoſe bleſſed Angels viſibly communicate with the holy men and Magicians of old! though now ſuch is the wickedneſs of our age, that they have almoſt quite forſaken us: although they are alwayes preſent about us, though inviſible, adminiſtring to us accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the orders given unto them from the ſecond Hierarchy, who receive the ſame from the firſt Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, who always attend before the Throne of the divine Majeſty, offering up the prayers of the Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If any one account this ſuperſtition, I hope I ſhall never be of the Number of thoſe who for fear of being ſuperſtitious, have reformed themſelves and hunted Religion till they have loſt the ſent of it, into meer Atheiſm and profaneſs.

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving firſt invocated the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, we will enterprize this Work; wherein we ſhall not only teach how to change any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Metal into bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as Iron into Copper, this into Silver, and that into Gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but alſo to help all infirmities, whoſe cure to the opinionated and preſumptuous Phyſitians, doth ſeem impoſſible: But that which is greater, to preſerve, and keep mortal men to a long, ſound, and perfect Age. This ART was by our Lord God the Supream Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, ingraven as it were in a book in the body of Metals, from the beginning of the Creation, that we might diligently learn from them. Therefore when any
<pb facs="tcp:170095:10"/>
man deſireth throughly and perfectly to learn this Art from its true foundation, it will be neceſſary that he learn the ſame from the Maſter thereof, to wit, from God, who hath created all things, and onely knoweth what Nature and Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he himſelf hath placed in every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Wherefore he is able to teach e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one certainly and perfectly: and from him we may learn abſolutely, as he hath ſpoken, ſaying, <hi>Of me ye ſhall learn all things:</hi> for there is nothing found in Heaven nor in Earth ſo ſecret, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties he perceiveth not, and moſt exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knoweth and ſeeth, who hath created all things. We will therefore take him to be our Maſter, Operator, and Leader into this moſt true Art. We will therefore imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him alone, and through him learn and attain to the knowledge of that Nature, which he himſelf with his own finger hath engraven and inſcribed in the bodies of theſe Metals. Hereby it will come to paſs, that the moſt high Lord God ſhall bleſs all the Creatures unto us, and ſhall ſanctifie all our Wayes; ſo that in this Work we may be able to bring our Beginning to its deſired End, and the Conſequence thereof
<pb facs="tcp:170095:10"/>
to produce exceeding great Joy and Love in our Hearts.</p>
            <p>But if any one ſhall follow his own onely Opinion, he will not onely greatly deceive himſelf; but alſo all others who cleave and adhere thereunto; and ſhall bring them unto loſs. For mankinde is certainly born in ignorance, ſo that he can neither know nor underſtand any thing of himſelf; but onely that which he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from God, and underſtandeth from Nature. He which learneth nothing from theſe, is like the Heathen Maſters and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, who follow the Subtilties and Crafts of their own Inventions and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, ſuch as are <hi>Aristotle, Hippocrates, Avicenna, Gallen,</hi> &amp;c. who grounded all their ARTS upon their own Opinions onely. And if at any time they learned any thing from Nature, they deſtroyed it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with their own Phantaſies, Dreams, or Inventions, before they came to the end thereof; ſo that by them and their Followers there is nothing perfect at all to be found.</p>
            <p>This therefore hath moved and induced us hereunto, to write a peculiar book of Alchymy, founded not upon men, but
<pb facs="tcp:170095:11"/>
upon Nature it ſelf, and upon thoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Powers, which GOD with his own Finger hath impreſſed in Metals. Of this impreſſion <hi>Mercurius Triſmegistus</hi> was an Imitator, who is not undeſervedly called the Father of all Wiſe-men, and of all thoſe that followed this ART with love, and with earneſt deſire; and that man demonſtrateth and teacheth, that God alone is the onely author, cauſe and Original of all creatures in this ART. But he doth not attribute the power and virtue of God, to the creatures or viſible things, as the ſaid heathen, and ſuch-like did. Now ſeeing all ART ought to be learned from the Trinity; that is, from God the Father, from God the Son of God, our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and from God the holy Ghoſt, three diſtinct perſons, but one God: We will therefore divide this our Alchymiſtical worke into three parts, or Treatiſes: in the firſt whereof, we will lay down what the ART containeth in it ſelf; And what is the propriety and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of every Metal: Secondly, by what means a man may worke and bring the like powers and ſtrength of Metals to effect. And thirdly, what Tinctures are to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the Sun and Moone.</p>

                  <p>The prime and chief ſubject to this Art belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is fire; which always liveth in one and the ſame propriety and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170095:12"/>
neither can it receive life from any thing elſe. Wherefore it hath a condition and power, as all fires that lie hid in ſecret things, have, of vivification, no otherwiſe then the Sun is appointed of God, which heateth all the things of the world, both ſecret, apparent &amp; manifeſt; as the Spheres of <hi>Mars, Saturn, Venus, Jupiter, Mercury,</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> which can give no other light but what they borrow from the Sun, for they are dead of themſelves. Nevertheleſs, when they are kindled, as above is ſpoken, they worke and operate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their properties. But the Sun himſelf receiveth his light from no other but from God himſelf, who ruleth him by himſelf, ſo that he burneth and ſhineth in him. It is no otherwiſe in this art. The fire in the furnace is compared to the Sun, which heateth the furnace and the veſſels, as the Sun in the great world; for even as nothing can be brought forth in the world without the Sun, ſo likewiſe in this Art nothing can be produced without this Simple fire; no operation can be made without it: it is the greateſt ſecret of this Art; comprehending all things which are comprehended therein, neither can it be comprehended in any elſe; for it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth by it ſelf: it lacketh nothing; but other things which want that, do injoy it, and have life from it; wherefore we have in the firſt place undertooke to declare it.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the multiplicity of fire, from which varieties of Metalls do ariſe.</head>
                  <p>WE have firſt written of ſimple fire which liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and ſubſiſteth of it ſelf: now we come to ſpeake of a manifold ſpirit or fire, which is the cauſe of variety and diverſity of creatures, ſo that there cannot one be found right like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the ſame in every part; as it may be ſeen in Metals, of which there is none which hath another like it ſelf; the <hi>Sun</hi> produceth his gold; the <hi>Moon</hi> produceth another Metal far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, to wit, ſilver; <hi>Mars</hi> another, that is to ſay, Iron; <hi>Jupiter</hi> produceth another kind of Metal, to wit, Tin; <hi>Venus</hi> another, which is Copper; and <hi>Saturn</hi> another kind, that is to ſay, Lead: ſo that they are all unlike, and ſeveral one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the ſame appeareth to be as well amongſt men as all other creatures, the cauſe whereof is the multiplicity of fire. As by ſome heat is produced a mean generation by the corruption thereof; the waſhing of the Sea another, Aſhes another, Sand another, Flame of fire another, and another of Coales, &amp;c. This variety of creatures is not made of the firſt ſimple fire, but of the regiment of elements, which is various; not from the Sun, but from the courſe of the ſeven Planets. And this is the reaſon that the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170095:13"/>
world containeth nothing of ſimilitude in its individuals: for as the heat is altered and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every hour and minute; ſo alſo all other things are varyed: for the tranſmutation of the fire is made in the elements, in which bodies it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed by this fire. Where there is no great mixture of the elements, the Sun bringeth forth; where it is a little more thicke, the <hi>Moon;</hi> where more groſs, <hi>Venus:</hi> and thus according to the diverſity of mixtures, are produced divers Metals; ſo that no Metal appeareth in the ſame mine like another. It is therefore to be known, that this variety of Metals is made of the mixture of the Elements, becauſe that their ſpirits are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo found divers and without ſimilitude; which if they were brought forth from the ſimple fire, they would be ſo like, that one could not be known from another: but the manifold variety of forms interceding, hath introduced the ſame among the creatures. From this it may eaſily be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, why ſo many and ſo various forms of Metals are found, and wherefore there is none like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another.</p>

                  <p>NOw we come to the ſpirits of the Planets or Metals. The ſpirit or tincture of the <hi>Sun</hi> taketh its beginning from a pure, ſubtil, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect fire; whereby it cometh to paſs, that it far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170095:13"/>
all other ſpirits and tinctures of Metals: for it remaineth conſtantly fixed in the fire, out of which it flyeth not; neither is it conſumed thereby, much leſs burnt, but rather appeareth more cleere, faire and pure by it; alſo no heat nor cold can hurt it, nor no other accident, as in the other ſpirits or tinctures of Metals: and for this cauſe, the body which it once putteth on, it defendeth from all accidents and diſeaſes, that it may be able to ſuſtain the fire without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment. This body hath not this power and virtue in it ſelf, but from the ſpirit of the Sun which is included therein: for we know that the Sun is the body of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and that this body cannot ſuſtain nor ſuffer this fire, but flyeth from it; when as it doth not fly from the fire when it is in the Sun, but remaineth conſtant and fixed therein. This affordeth unto us a moſt certain Judgement, that it receiveth ſuch a conſtancy from his ſpirit or tincture: wherefore if that ſpirit can be in this <hi>Mercury,</hi> every one may judge that it may worke the ſame in the bodies of men, when it is received of them; as we have ſufficiently ſpoken in our <hi>Magna Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> of the tincture of the <hi>Sun,</hi> that it will not onely reſtore and preſerve them that uſe it, from infirmities, but alſo preſerve them to ſound and long life. In like manner, the ſtrength &amp; virtues of all other Metals are to be known from true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, not from the wiſdom of men and of the world, which is fooliſhneſs with God &amp; his truth; and all thoſe who do build upon that wiſdom, and repoſe their hope thereupon are miſerably deceived.</p>

                  <p>HAving now ſpoken of the tincture of the <hi>Sun,</hi> it remaineth that we come now to ſpeak of the tincture of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and of the white tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, which is alſo created of a perfect ſpirit, but leſs perfect then the ſpirit of the <hi>Sun.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs it excelleth the tinctures of all other Metals following, both in purity &amp; ſubtilty; which is very well known to all that treat of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and alſo to Ruſticks: for it ſuffereth not ruſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their is it conſumed by the fire; as all other Metals, as <hi>Saturn,</hi> which fly from the fire; but this doth not: from whence it may be gathered, that this tincture is far more excellent then the other following, for it preſerveth its body that it aſſumeth conſtantly in the fire, without any accident or detriment: and from hence it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently manifeſt, if this in his own corruptible body by himſelf maketh <hi>Mercury,</hi> what will it be able to effect, being extracted from it ſelf into another body? will not that alſo ſave and defend from infirmities and accidents after the ſame manner? Yes ſurely, if it make this <hi>Mercury</hi> in its own body, it will do the ſame in the bodies of men: neither doth it onely preſerve health, but cauſeth long life, and cureth diſeaſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, even in thoſe who ſubſiſt beyond
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170095:14"/>
the ordinary courſe of nature: for the more high, ſubtile and perfect the medicine is, ſo much the better and more perfectly it cureth; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are Ignorant Phyſitians, who practice their Art onely upon vegetables, as herbs and ſuch-like things, which are eaſily corrupted: and by theſe, they endeaour to effect &amp; bring to paſs ſuch workes as are firme and ſtable; but in vain, whenas they occupy the Aire. But wherefore ſhould we ſpeake much concerning theſe? They never learned any better things in their Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities: therefore if they have been compelled ſo to learn and ſtudy from their beginning, they think it a great diſgrace to them to do otherwiſe for the future: whereby it comes to paſs, that they ſtill continue in their old Ignorance.</p>

                  <p>WE have even now made mention of a white ſpirit, or candid tincture: now we come to ſpeake of a Red ſpirit, which is derived out of a Groſs Elementary mixture of the ſuperiours, to which alſo it is joyned, &amp; is of a more perfect ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, then the ſpirits and tinctures of the other ſubſequent Metals, becauſe it endureth the fire longer then the other, and is not ſo ſoon melted or diſſolved as the other ſpirits which follow. Alſo the ayre, and the humidity of the fire, are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170095:15"/>
not ſo nocent unto it, as unto <hi>Mars;</hi> by reaſon whereof, it doth the longer endure the fire. This power and property hath <hi>Venus,</hi> that is his body, from the ſpirit that is infuſed into it. Now the ſame effect that it worketh in its own body, that is, in <hi>Venus,</hi> the ſame effects it alſo produeth in the bodies of men, ſo far forth as nature hath granted unto it; for it preſerveth wounds in ſuch manner, ſo that no accident can invade them, nor the Air or water hurt them; and expelleth all ſuch diſeaſes as are under the degree thereof. This ſpirit alſo breaketh the bodies of Metals, ſo that they will endure the hammer; and alſo in the bodies of men, when it is taken of them with whom it agreeth not, it effecteth things not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient. Wherefore it is very neceſſary, that the Phyſitian that deſires to make uſe of theſe ſpirits, be very expert in the knowledge of Metals. Therefore it is far better to uſe the more perfect ſpirits, which may be taken without any ſuch feare of danger: nevertheleſs, ſeeing the ſpirits of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> are dear and precious, ſo that every one is not able to accompliſh them, to perform cures with, therefore every one muſt take according to his ability, what he is able to attain unto: alſo every one is not ſo wealthy, that he can be able to prepare theſe medicines; therefore he is forced to take ſuch as he can have. Every one may from hence eaſily gather, that the Metallike medicines do far exceed vegetables and Animals in ſtrength and power of curing and healing. And thus-much of the ſpirit of <hi>Venus.</hi>

                  <p>THat we may now come to ſpeake of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Mars,</hi> that is of a more Groſs and combuſtible mixture of Elements, then the other ſpirits going before; but the Spirit of <hi>Mars</hi> is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a greater hardneſs then the other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; ſo that it doth not ſo eaſily melt and diſſolve in the fire, as the other following. But it ſuffers much hurt both by the water and the Aire, ſo that it is conſumed by them, and is burnt with the fire, as experience makes appeare: Wherefore the Spirit thereof is more imperfect then any of the ſuperiour ſpirits: but in hardneſs and dryneſs it exceedeth all other Metals, both ſuperiour and inferiour: for it doth not onely retain a perfect ſubſtance, and reſiſt the hammer, as the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> but alſo as thoſe which are within it ſelf, as <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> and the like. Whereas therefore it thus worketh in Metals, it ſheweth that it hath the ſame effect in the bodies of men, that is, it produceth reluctancy; eſpecially where it is taken for a diſeaſe not convenient, it grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicteth the members with pain. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, when it is taken and applyed for wounds, ſuch as do not exceed its own degree, it cleanſeth and mundifieth them, &amp;c.

man and wife; for they are both derived of the groſs ſpirits of metals, except that the body of <hi>Sol</hi> remaineth firm &amp; fixed in the fire: but the quicke <hi>Mercury</hi> is not fixed; nevertheleſs they may be appropriated one to another, as graine of corn or ſeed are to the earth; which we will demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate by an example, after this manner: If any one ſowe barley, the ſame he ſhall reape; if Wheat or Rye, or any other grain, the ſame he ſhall gather, &amp;c. even ſo it is in this art; if any one ſowe the Gold of <hi>Sol,</hi> the ſame he reapeth; &amp; of the <hi>Moon,</hi> he ſhall gather; and ſo alſo of all other Metals. For this reaſon we ſay in this place, that the Tinctures do ſpring out of Mettals, that is, out of the Philoſophers <hi>Mercury,</hi> and not from the quicke <hi>Mercury;</hi> but this produceth the Seed which firſt conceiveth.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170095:20"/>
for the Spirits of Metals are dead of themſelves, and do reſt, ſo that they cannot at all operate of themſelves, unleſs they are quickned by the fire.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170095:22"/>
four fingers broad, and let every hole of the Furnace be ſupplied with a Copper Cauldron to contain the Water. Afterwards, take good and hard Coals, which you ſhall break in Gobbets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the bigneſs of a Walnut; with theſe fill the long Furnace; which then is to be ſtopped up, that they may not burn out. And afterwards, let ſome Coals be kindled to the holes below: if the Fire be too great, lay a ſtone before it; if too little, ſtir the Coals with an Iron-inſtrument, that they may be pierced with the Air, and the Heat may be increaſed. This way you may keep your Fire, according to the true Exigency of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; neither too exceſſive, nor too ſmall; but moſt fit and apt for the motion of the Matter: this is compared to the Firmament.

And for this Cauſe, the Woman is united to the Man, ſo that ſhe receiveth the Man, and he fixeth and faſtneth her firm and conſtant in any balance; as it followeth, They are both to be ſo cloſe

and ſetting forth every thing that may be inveſtigated, effected and brought to paſs thereby: this Philoſophy in the practice thereof is much abuſed, by Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and other abuſes; and hitherto the foundation thereof hath been built falſely upon the ſand; whereby the whole Artifice and inſtruments thereof are overthrowne with the leaſt winde, and ſometimes the Artificers themſelves, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Nigromancers, are taken away out of the very middeſt thereof, with the windes, that is, with the Spirits, and are vanquiſhed, overcome and carryed away.

               <p>Therefore all Ceremonies, Conjurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Conſecrations, and ſuch like vanities are to be rejected and caſt away, with all vain foundations, &amp; the true corner-ſtone is the foundation that is onely to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced in our hearts, that is, every thing which proceedeth and ſpringeth from the holy Scriptures, the light of nature, and fountain of truth: we will write therefore in moſt briefe and plain words, the moſt occult and ſecret things, which neither <hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi> nor <hi>Peter de Abano,</hi> much leſs <hi>Tritemius,</hi> never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood or wrote of. Neither let any one raiſe ſcandall upon this my writing of Philoſophy, but firſt rather let him well peruſe and ponder every word; and then

it will appeare from whom I ſpeake, and whether I have this knowledge from the Devil, or from the experience of the pure light of nature.</p>

                  <p>As often as the Ceremonial Nigromancers ſay, that this is conſecrated and bleſſed, or that many Maſſes are celebrated thereupon. Wherefore they all ſay, that they are of power againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and the malignant Spirits, who are terrified with fear and dread thereof, and flie there-from, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and dare not come neer it.</p>
                  <p>O you very arch-Fools, and ignorant men of no worth! even unworthy of the name of men, who do give Faith and credit to ſuch monſtrous and palpable lyes, when you ſee notwithſtanding examples thereof before your eyes; when ſo much lightning falls upon the Temples, that it burns and deſtroyes the Altars; which chiefly happens by the Tempeſts raiſed with Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; alſo, when the Devil and the malignant Spirits are ſeen to raign about theſe places, and are heard by the Magitians what they ſpeak. Therefore Negromancy with all its Ceremonies, is abſolute wickedneſs, a Viper uſed amongſt Juglers, a wicked work, which blindeth the eyes

of the ſpectators, deceiving them of their Money; but in truth is not to be eſteemed worth a half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny, ſcarce a ſtraw or ruſh: wherefore are not to be induced or made uſe of herein; as <hi>Judeus Solomon</hi> in his book hath written, which the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gromancers call, The Key of <hi>Solomon.</hi> For God would not have them to be uſed; but hath given another thing inſtead thereof, to wit, Faith; which perfectly conſecrateth all things. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, I would not have all Conſecrations to be rejected, but onely thoſe Ceremonies, which are aſſumed to be uſed againſt the phantaſtick and malignant Spirits. But I do not deſire, that any thing ſhould be derogated from thoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Ceremonies and Operations, which are made for Phyſical uſes: neither, eſpecially the Conſecrations in Matrimony, and in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper, which are to be kept and obſerved by us in the higheſt eſteem and reverence alwayes, unto the laſt day.

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of Conjurations.</head>
                  <p>BEfore we come to treat of Conjurations, whence they proceed, and what is the foundation of them; It is firſt neceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, who invented them, who uſed them, and what hath been brought to paſs by them; and how more and more they came to be abuſed. Know therefore, that they had their original Spring and fountain from Babylon; and there did mightily increaſe and flouriſh: afterwards it came into Aegypt, and from thence to the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites; and laſt of all, to us Chriſtians. Amongſt the Nigromancers it is very familiar, and held in great eſteeme, ſo that in their rude and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant underſtandings, they all attribute more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy, power and vertue thereunto, then unto prayer and faith. This foundation, which is drawne onely from their opinions, is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, ſo that no man almoſt ought to remain therein; but they all Juſtly deſerve to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Magiſtrate who perſiſt therein. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Conjurations may be able to effect ſome things in themſelves, nevertheleſs they are not to be uſurped by any Magitian or wiſe man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are contrary even to God himſelf, and to his word and commandments, and alſo to the light of nature: For nothing of truth can
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170095:29"/>
be forced or drawn from the Spirits thereby: although they are ſometimes forced to appeare in their greateſt and Magnificent pompe, and with terrible pride and haughtineſs, nevertheleſs they are not bound or overcome by this Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; for that can onely be done by faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, thoſe kinde of Nigromancers who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to perform and effect all things by their Conjurations, ſo as to compel, binde, afflict and Torment the Spirits, forcing to do what they will have them, are moſt like and fitly to be compared to thieves and Robbers, that lurk in woods and places to Rob and murder; who can kill and ſteale ſo long, and ſo far forth as God ſhall permit them, but no longer: But when the time and hour comes, that their villanies and wickedneſs ſhall be made manifeſt; then not one of the moſt ſubtil and craftyeſt of them can eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape: whereby it comes to paſs, that one for Robbery receives his death, another is accuſed, and at laſt comes under the power of the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who renders him a reward according to the deſert of his workes: No otherwiſe are we to judge of ſuch thieves who breake houſes and ſteal ſo long, till at laſt they periſh at the gallows. So likewiſe doth the Nigromancer call and invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Spirits, conjure and afflict them with puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Martyrdomes, ſo long as he ſhall be permitted by the Lord God; but not without the curſe of God: and when the time and hour of his puniſhment is come, then as the Proverbe is, he receiveth his fruits: he erred in his Conjurations,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170095:30"/>
not drawing his Circle as he ought, out of the will and power of the Spirits, which they often ſay unto him: To wit, thou haſt erred in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring, or thou haſt not rightly drawn the Circle, thou haſt not Chaſtiſed and prepared thy ſelf e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; or that thy Seale and Pentacles are falſe: wherefore thou receiveſt this puniſhment: ſo thy debts are paid thee in ready money, a long time reſerved for thee; and which long ſince thou oughteſt to have had: ſo he deſervedly receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his reward from the Spirits, who leave ſome notable eminent marke remaining upon him; or mayme him in ſome limbe or member, if not quite breake his necke: and by this he becomes his own executioner.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let theſe Ceremonious Nigroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers take heed and looke what they do; let them ſet this chapter as a looking-Glaſs before them, leſt by their own frivolous and wicked ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration they themſelves become the ſervants of the Spirits, and ſuffer them to rule over them, and be their own executioners: Which being done, the Spirits will not ſuffer themſelves any longer to be forced or compelled by theſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; neither will they do what they will, but now the ſervants ſhall be forced to yeeld obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Spirits, who are become their Lords. The hang-man alſo doth the like, he hearkneth not to him that is to be ſcourged, neither will he ſhew any mercy or favor at the prayer of him that is condemned; but he executeth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Maſter, and what appertains unto his office.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:170095:30"/>Even ſo alſo the Malignant Spirits are the hang-men and executioners of God, who can execute nothing without the commiſſion of their Magiſtrate, that is, of the divine Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>I ſay therefore that all Conjurations are againſt God, and are contrary to his word, the divine law, and the light of nature; which are prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be uſed not onely to Spirits alone, but alſo ſuch as are directed to herbs, ſtones and ſuch-like, and eſpecially thoſe which are made againſt men; it becometh not us to act like the Heathens, who when they were not able to uſe men after their own wills, and could not force and compel them, they did Conjure them (as by many examples it is found in the Scriptures) ſo that they were forced and compelled to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute and act ſuch things as were contrary to their wills and nature. Woe therefore to ſuch wicked Knaves, and to all them whoſoever imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them: how great wickedneſs do they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit? And what grievous Plagues will come to them at the laſt, and what fearful and horrible accuſations ſhall they heare the Devil make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them before the wrath of God? If after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it were lawful for them to ſignifie to ſuch kinde of men, their miſery which they endure, they who do ſuch things, many thouſands of them would be brought to repentance.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of Characters.</head>
                  <p>WE are not to give credit alſo, neither to Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters nor Words; for the Poets and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gromancers do alſo much exerciſe themſelves in them, and do fill their Conjuring-Books full of them, which they raiſe out of their own imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, meerly and raſhly, without any Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and do feign them againſt all Truth; whenas many thouſands of them are not worth a nut-ſhell. But in the mean time I will be ſilent in their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, which they draw in Paper &amp; Parchment, which are uſeleſsly blotted with ſuch trifles. It was a cuſtome amongſt thoſe kinde of men, which amongſt ſome is hardly left to this day, That by impoſing theſe Characters upon theſe men, they drew them to admiration of themſelves with theſe Characters, and ſpeaking ſuch words as are wonderful to me, and which were never heard of; yet they ſay, they are found out and deviſed by themſelves. Wherefore it is chiefly neceſſary to have perfect knowledge, to diſcern theſe Letter, Words and Characters.</p>
                  <p>There are many ſuch-kinde of words found amongſt them, which have no affinity at all with the Idioms of the Latine, Greek, or Hebrew Tongues, neither with any other; which cannot poſſibly be interpreted by any man, nor rendred
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170095:31"/>
into any other Tongue. Therefore I ſpeak not without cauſe, and ſay, That we are not to credit all Letters, Characters or Words, but to keep to thoſe onely which are true, and have been often proved, and taken out of the Foundation of Truth.</p>
                  <p>That we may come to theſe, and declare what Words or Characters are juſt and true; we ſhall onely in the firſt place detect and unfold two: although there may be found many other, yet nevertheleſs, theſe are moſt eſpecially and principally to be accounted and eſteemed of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other Characters, Pentacles, and Seals: note the delineation of them, which is thus:</p>
                  <p>Two Triangular Figures, cutting one another thorow with a croſs, are ſo painted or engraven, that they do include and divide themſelves into ſeven ſpaces within, and do make ſix corners outwardly, wherein are written ſix wonderful Letters of the great Name of God; to wit, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donay,</hi> according to their true order. This is one of thoſe Characters whereof we have ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>There is another which excelleth the former in power and virtue, and this hath three Hooks cutting one another through by a croſs, and are ſo delineated, that by their mutual interſection they include ſix ſpaces, and outwardly five angles, wherein are written five ſyllables of the ſupream name of God; to wit, <hi>Tetragrammaton,</hi> alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their true order.</p>
                  <p>I would have put down the Figures themſelves; but becauſe you may happily finde them in many
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170095:32"/>
other places and Books, I have the rather omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them.</p>
                  <p>By theſe two Characters ſome of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and Nigromancers of <hi>Judea,</hi> obtained many things; and they are now eſteemed of great price amongſt very many, and held as great ſecrets: for they are of ſo great virtue and power, that whatſoever is poſſible to be done by Characters and Words, the ſame may be effected by them or one of them. I would gladly know, where and in what place in all the Books of the Nigro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancers may be found any other, wherein there is made the like againſt the malignant Spirits, Devils, &amp; Inchantments of the Magitians, by all the deceits and devices of the Sorcerers. For they do deliver him that is already inchanted either in his minde or underſtanding, ſo that he is forced or compelled to act any thing againſt his own natural will or nature; or if he ſuffer any loſs or hurt in his body, by the adminiſtration of theſe, made in their juſt and due time and hour, and being taken in his mouth with a Wafer, Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cake, or ſuch-like thing, in four and twenty hours he ſhall be free from the Inchantment.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo many other thing which are helpful in ſuch caſes; as thoſe which ſhall be by me laid down hereafter, when I come to ſpeak of Tempeſts, and the Seaſons.</p>
                  <p>Briefly, theſe Characters are of ſo great force and power, that if the Nigromancers did but know and believe their power and and virtue, they would forthwith reject and caſt away all other things, even all their other Characters,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170095:32"/>
Words, Names, Signs, Figures, Pentacles, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Seals of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Crowns, Scepters, Rings, Girdles, and ſuch-like Ceremonies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, and wherein hitherto they have repoſed any hope, thinking by them to ſecure themſelves from their dangerous experiments and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when they would invoke, conjure, or think to compel and force the Spirits. Truely thoſe which we have ſpoken of, are the true Pentacles to be had and uſed againſt all unclean Spirits, which they do all fear, even they which wander in the Elements. Nevertheleſs, Faith doth ſtrengthen and confirm all theſe things.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may carpingly object, although unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervingly, and ſay, That I break the third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God, of the firſt Table of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> wherein it is forbidden of the Lord God, for any one to take his name in vain. But who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt any wiſe men, can be able to ſay, That I have done this; or, that I have herein offended God? whenas I uſe not this for that purpoſe, nor after the ſame manner, as the Nigromancers and Inchanters; but onely for the extream neceſſity and help of men, and in thoſe diſeaſes and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities wherein no Medicines, no <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> nor quinteſſence of Gold, neither Antimony, nor no ſuch ſecret can help them, although they are of very great virtue and efficacy.</p>
                  <p>It becometh a Phyſitian to know the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cauſe of all diſeaſes, that he may know which proceeds from evil meat or drink, as from Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Herbs, and other fruits of the Earth: and it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170095:33"/>
is expedient for him to know the ſecrets of Herbs and Roots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby the diſeaſe may be cured. But if it happen under the cauſe of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, ſuch diſeaſes are to be expelled by the ſecrets of thoſe Metals; which the ſecrets of Herbs and Roots do not admit of, and have not power to do.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, if diſeaſes do proceed from the influences of Heaven, neither of the ſecrets aforeſaid, are able to profit any thing in the cure thereof, but it muſt be expelled by Aſtronomy and the heavenly influences, as it is written of <hi>Parſicaria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if any diſeaſe or grief happen or be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon any man in a ſupernatural manner, by Inchantment or ſome Magical Sorceries, none of thoſe three remedies aforeſpoken of, will help them; but there muſt be a Magical remedy whereby it may be expelled, as we have before delivered.</p>
                  <p>Many men who have in this kinde been made miſerable through inchantments, have alſo hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been forſaken and caſt off by the Ignorant Phyſitians; becauſe theſe things hitherto were hidden unto them: And if they chance to be told them of others, they will anſwer, that if they ſhould uſe them, they ſhould act againſt God, and take his name in vain; and that this which I have done hath no truth in it. But if I ſhould uſe theſe things to the hurt or prejudice of man, I ſhould Blaſpheme againſt God; or if I ſhould Conjure any Spirits, man, herbe, roote or ſtone, &amp;c. by his name, it might then juſtly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170095:33"/>
be ſaid that I did take his name in vain, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God; but not before. Let the Divines them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alſo, and the Sophiſters ſpeake what they liſt to theſe things, the thing which I ſpeake will not be found contrary to the truth, although herein their opinions may be very contrary unto me: they will call me Inchanter, Nigromancer, and a contemner of the Commandments of God, which Calumnies and reproches I do not at all care for: for it will be moſt certainly made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that their exceptions againſt me, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare no otherwiſe then thoſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> who carped againſt Chriſt, becauſe he healed the ſicke on the Sabbath day: For they ſaid unto him, that Chriſt had broke the Sabbath and the commandment of God: the like they did with <hi>David</hi> when he was forced and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and did eat the ſhew-bread; But amongſt theſe fault-finders and ſlanderers, how or what ſhall be done that will pleaſe them all? But the Ignorant will not ceaſe to talke until the beaſts or ſtones can teach them, which we muſt expect will be a long time, and then they will hold their peace.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of Spiritual viſions, appearing in dreames.</head>
                  <p>THere is a twofold kinde of viſions that do appeare in dreames, that is to ſay, natural
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170095:34"/>
and ſupernatural; but various kindes of appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and viſions there are, which do appeare in ſleepe and dreames, of which in this place it is unneceſſary to make any mention, becauſe they do moſt uſually happen, either by reaſon of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfulneſs, or ſome trouble and perturbation of the minde, uncleanneſs of the blood, Cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that is, operations of the minde and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and occupations thereof about multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of buſineſs and dealings that men are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed and converſant in; as gameſters, of the dice and chards, of great gain or loſs; Souldiers do dreame of warlike affaires, as of their gunnes, pieces of Ordnance, Powder, Armes, and all manner of weapons and inſtruments of war; of victory or overthrowes: the Sons of Bacchus, and great drinkers, of good wine and great cups, which they ſeeme to ſwallow; and of ſuch other things filling the belly: Pyrates dream of their ſpoyles and preyes, and what gain they have met with: Robbers, of Manſlaughters; theeves, of theft; and fornicators, of their whores. All theſe phantaſies and viſions the Spirit of the night produceth and bringeth unto them, whereby he playeth with them in the night, and deludeth and tempteth them: Such things are kindled in the blood, <hi>(alias)</hi> the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and begetteth ſuch a fire, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily be extinguiſhed, which for the moſt part may be ſeen in the venereous family.</p>
                  <p>Many wonderful Arts and Sciences alſo have ſeemed to be made appeare to Artiſts in their dreams; the reaſon whereof hath been, becauſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170095:34"/>
they have always had an ardent affection to thoſe Arts: ſo powerful an imagination thereof, hath for the moſt part followed the ſame, that they have ſuppoſed in their dreames, that ſome Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher hath taught them theſe Arts: this often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happeneth, but the greateſt part periſheth in oblivion: ſome riſing early in the morning, ſay, This night a wonderful dreame appeared to me, even as that Mercury, or this or that Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher corporally appeared unto me in a dreame, who taught me this or that Art; but it is fallen out of my memory, ſo that I cannot remember any more thereof. To whom any ſuch thing hath happened, he ought not to go forth out of his chamber, nor ſpeak with any man, but to remain alone and faſt, untill he call to remembrance that which he had forgotten. And thus much is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to be ſpoken concerning natural dreams, and viſions appearing in the night in dreames of what belongeth thereunto: But for the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuch kinde of viſions, one thing is yet to be declared; that amongſt all thoſe dreams that do rejoyce our Spirit, grieve us, or cauſe ſorrow, commonly that which is the contrary cometh to paſs: wherefore ſuch like kinde of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not alwayes to be credited.</p>
                  <p>But the other dreames which are ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, are moſt certain Ambaſſadors, and true Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats &amp; meſſengers ſent unto us from God, which are nothing elſe but Angels and Good Spirits, who ſometimes do appeare to us in our greateſt neceſſities: Even as it happened to the three wiſe men when they had come a great Journey
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170095:35"/>
o ſeeke the young infant; after they had found him, they would have returned to <hi>Herod,</hi> to tell him where the child was, and how they found him: but the Angel of the Lord appeared unto them in a dreame, ſaying, <hi>Do not return to him, but return into your own Country another way.</hi> For God knew the falſe heart of <hi>Herod,</hi> from which he ſpoke, wherefore he would not ſuffer his will to be performed. The like dreame happened to <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he would go into Aegypt: the ſame in like manner happened to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias, Cornelius,</hi> and many others; all whoſe dreams are ſupernatural: ſuch dreams do ſomtimes alſo happen to men in our times, but they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing eſteemed, yet nevertheleſs they are not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious. We are likewiſe to know that theſe kinde of viſions may be obtained by us by prayer from our Lord God, in our greateſt neceſſities, ſo that our prayers be made with a ſincere heart, and with a true and undoubted faith, then he will at length ſend his Angel unto us, who will appeare unto us, and ſpiritually admoniſh, teach, and promiſe us.</p>

                     <hi>Balaam</hi> was moſt expert in theſe kinde of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: for every night, as often as he would, he could obtain a viſion of this kinde: yet the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath given him an obſcure name, to wit, an Inchanter: it is not expedient to make any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, for the Scripture obſerveth no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence herein, but calleth all them Inchanters who have experience and knowledge in the vertues of natural things; nevertheleſs, great diſcretion is to be uſed in theſe things; God would have
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170095:35"/>
us to walke in ſimplicity, as the Apoſtles did, and not to ſearch too deeply into ſuch high, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe, and ſecret things above nature; that we fall not into the abuſe thereof, and therewith hurt our neighbour: and ſo come into condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation both of body and ſoule. They are not therefore all Inchanters which the Scripture call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo: for then it would follow that thoſe three wiſe men of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> ſhould be Arch-Inchanters; when as in all Arts, eſpecially in ſuch as were ſupernatural, they excelled all others before their time: therefore that the Scriptures do not call them Inchanters, but wiſe men; what elſe can be gathered from them, but that they did in no wiſe abuſe their Arts and occult wiſdome? For Magicke is ſuch an Art and ſcience which demonſtrateth and declareth the power and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof by faith: nevertheleſs Inchantments may ſpring from thence, to wit, when it is uſed abuſively; and before, it cannot be called an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment.</p>
                  <p>But that I may ſpeake more largely of viſions in dreams; it is to be known, that ſome have been ſo ſpiritually lifted up to God in a dream, that they have ſeen his glory and the joy of the elect, and the puniſhment of the damned; which they could never afterwards forget, but have carryed the ſame in their hearts and mindes until the end of their life; It is poſſible, I ſay, for us to ſee all theſe things in a ſpiritual manner: when we ſeeke for and implore the mercy of God, with a true faith and prayer, we may behold all the Myſteryes of God very well, as <hi>Eſaias</hi> &amp; <hi>John:</hi> Theſe kinde
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170095:36"/>
of viſions are certain and true; to which more faith is to be given, then to all the precepts in Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gromancy by looking-Glaſſes, Chriſtals, Beryls, nailes of the fingers, ſtones, waters, and the like; for all theſe are falſe and fallacious: and although ſuch Spirits do ſometime ſpeake in ſuch appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and anſwer, and do aſſert the ſame with an hundred Oaths, with erection of the fingers; yet we are not alway to give faith or credit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, unleſs perchance it be done out of the ſpecial command of God: otherwiſe they cannot poſſibly ſpeake truth of all viſions, which we have ſpoken of; thoſe Propheſies do come from a true original, which do agree with all the Prophets. From whence had the Prophets their wiſdome and knowledge, and from whence were thoſe Myſteries of God revealed unto them, by which they had thoſe Spiritual and ſupernatural viſions in dreams? It is neceſſary therefore, in the firſt place, to the finde out the true foundation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and to lay the ſame upon the right ſtone, which is the word of God and his promiſes; and to pray daily unto God; whereby it ſhall come to paſs that he will give us all things which he hath promiſed in his word.</p>

                  <head>Of Perſons and Spirits wandring under the Earth.</head>
                  <p>UNder the Earth do wander half-men, which poſſeſs all temporal things, which they want or are delighted with; they are Vulgarly called <hi>Gnomi,</hi> or Inhabiters of the Mountains: but by their proper name, they are called <hi>Sylphes</hi> or <hi>Pigmies:</hi> They are not Spirits, as others are, but are compared unto them, for the Similitude of their Arts and Induſtry, which are common to them with the Spirits: they have fleſh and blood as men, which no real Spirit hath: as Chriſt ſpoke unto his Diſciples, when he came amongſt them, when the doores were ſhut, and they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, ſaying, <hi>Feele me, and touch me, for a Spirit
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170095:37"/>
hath not fleſh and blood nor bones, as I have:</hi> By this he himſelf hath taught us, that a Spirit hath no true body that can be touched; nor bones, nor fleſh, nor blood, but exiſteth in its own eſſence of winde or Aire. But of this we have briefly ſpoken enough; But to return to the earthly <hi>Pigmies</hi> or halfe-men, we are to know that theſe are not to be reputed Spirits, but like to Spirits; but if they are or ſhall be called Spirits, they ought to be called earthly Spirits, becauſe they have their Chaos and habitation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the earth, and not in the winde and Aire, as the other Spirits have.</p>
                  <p>Many terrene earthly Spirits are found, ſeen, and heard to be in ſuch places, wherein great treaſures, and mighty ſtore of wealth and Riches are hid; and alſo under thoſe Mountains, where there is plenty of Gold and Silver; with which things they are delighted, and do take the care and cuſtody thereof, and not willingly do they part from it.</p>
                  <p>Such as digge Metals have the beſt knowledge of theſe Spirits, for they are moſt troubled with them, and do vexe them, and much perſecute them with blowes and ſtripes: ſomtimes alſo they do afford benefits unto them, admoniſhing them, and warning them of death: as when they are heard once, twice, thrice or oftener to Knock and ſtrike in the ſame place, it ſignifies the death of him that diggeth or laboureth in that place; either he is buryed up by the fall of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or dyeth by ſome ſuch occaſion: this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly experienced by them that do digge in Mines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:170095:37"/>Theſe Spirits are worſt againſt thoſe who do not appear to be Devils, and chiefly againſt thoſe which they hate: but between theſe Spirits and the Devil, there is a great difference; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he dyeth not, but theſe periſh after they have lived a long life, otherwiſe they might be called Spirits for this reaſon: but that which hath fleſh and blood, is obnoxious to death, and ought once to die. There is another thing which we ſhall more largely declare from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon proverb, whereby it is reported that the Devil aboundeth in Riches, and poſſeſſeth much wealth, money, gold, and ſilver; and to have all treaſures hidden in the earth under his power, and to give out of them what he will, to them that make any Covenant with him. And from hence that common ſaying tooke its beginning, that the Devil for this very cauſe giveth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Riches plentifully, and every thing that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth, gold or ſilver to any one that preſcribeth himſelf unto him, &amp; giveth up himſelf ſolely to be his, ſo as to renounce and forget his Creator. But I ſay that all theſe things are lyes and fained fables, without any foundation or ground; which ought to be rejected of every diſcreet and wiſe man: For the devil is the pooreſt of all creatures, ſo that there is no creature ſo miſerable &amp; poore, above or under the earth, or in all the other Elements. Neither hath he any money, nor Riches, nor any power over them; how then can he give to this or that perſon, that which he poſſeſſeth not? But he is infinitely ſkilful and cunning in Arts; and hath power to give and to teach them to thoſe he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170095:38"/>
favoreth, and that he can wreſt away and delude with his deceit: he hath no money, neither gold nor ſilver can he give to any one; neither doth he ever take or require any bonds or obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from men ſealed with their blood, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compact or Covenant. But there are other Spirits which do ſuch things, ſuch as are the <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes,</hi> or <hi>Pygmies,</hi> which although they are perſons that are little by nature, yet they can appear to men as they will, great, or little; faire, deformed; rich or poore: they are not defective nor want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of knowledge in all kinde of Arts that are or can be found out in all the light of nature; but they have them, and contain the knowledge of them all within themſelves: they have enough of gold and ſilver, and the mines of all Metals under their power and cuſtody. In old times many of them have been found and heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, but now they ceaſe; but no man hitherto hath known, or could give a reaſon of their ſevering and ſeparation, ſeeing they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes been eſteemed to be Immortal creatures; becauſe no man could certainly be able to know or finde out their death, or could conſider any cauſe of their abſence: neither could any man for a long time be able to know what they now are, or whence they proceeded, or whither they wander, or what gift or office they have. Many do ſuppoſe that where they bring any benefits or good to men, that they are Angels, or good and familiar Spirits, ſent to thoſe men from God, and are afterwards by him taken from them, by reaſon of the greatneſs of their ſins: for often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170095:38"/>
they bring to men very many good offices and benefits, and do undertake and ſuſtaine many hard labours for them.</p>
                  <p>Others believe that they will not be ſeen by us, becauſe that when a man ſeeth them, he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out; ſo that they vaniſh away, and will not appear any more.</p>
                  <p>Many that do ſee or hear theſe Spirits, ſuppoſe that they are the Spirits and ſoules of men that have come to an evil death, ſo that they have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſperately drowned or hanged themſelves, or killed themſelves ſome other wayes; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from God their Saviour, have given themſelves to the devil: and for that cauſe, do wander about, and are reſerved by the devil unto the day of the laſt Judgement.</p>
                  <p>There have been ſome who have ſuppoſed that they are vaine Phantaſies, and that they have fore-ſhown and preſaged much good fortune to thoſe places wherein they have been ſeen or heard; which many times alſo hath ſo happened and come to paſs: but for the moſt part, faith ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth it; for of their own nature, they do not bring any fortune, unleſs God compelleth them or our faith. And on the contrary, they are not able to cauſe any misfortune, unleſs it be by the permiſſion of God.</p>
                  <p>And many do thinke that they are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments of the Magicians.</p>
                  <p>There are others who having ſeen and heard them about treaſures, have judged that they are the Spirits of men, who have hid treaſures in that place, and ought to remain there until the the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170095:39"/>
Laſt Judgement, or untill their cuſtody thereof is found out; and this opinion they receive from the words of Chriſt, where he ſaith, Where your treaſure is, there will your hearts be alſo. But I do not ſee any reaſon why they ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the heart for the Spirit, but that there is much difference between them; wherefore I ſay that all the Judgements which are ſpoken of before, are but falſe opinions, when as theſe are to be underſtood to be halfe-men, that bear rule and wander in the four Elements; and in the firſt and priſtine times of nature, they have been taken and worſhipped in ſtead of God: Theſe are they of whom God Almighty admoniſheth us in that Commandment of the firſt Table, ſaying, that we ſhall not have any other Gods but him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the waters (where the <hi>Nymphs</hi> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood) nor under the Earth, (by which he meaneth <hi>Sylphes</hi> or <hi>Pygmies</hi>) For the Lord our God is a jealous God, and for ſuch an offence puniſheth the ſins of the Fathers upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unto the third and fourth generation.</p>
                  <p>The Mountain of <hi>Venus</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> was much poſſeſſed with theſe Spirits for <hi>Venus</hi> her ſelf was a <hi>Nymph,</hi> and that Mountain was by a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as her Kingdome and <hi>Paradice:</hi> But ſhe is dead, whereby her Kingdome ceaſeth to be: but where or in what place is there any mention heard to be made of them, as in former time, when <hi>Danhanſerus,</hi> and many others entred in unto them? Neither did they Invent theſe fables: they were of ſuch a nature and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they loved all men that loved them;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170095:39"/>
and hated them that hated them: wherefore they gave Arts and Riches in abundance, to them who preſcribed and bound themſelves to them; and they know both our minds and thoughts, whereby it comes to paſs, that they are eaſily moved by us to come to us. I do not ſay this, that I would give this Counſel to any one, but that the true ground and foundation thereof might be known, and the true difference which is between the devil and theſe <hi>Semi-homines.</hi> The devil hath not any body, unleſs he take any thing to himſelf from the four Elements; for he hath neither fleſh nor blood: he remaineth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, not ſubject to any infirmities or a finite death; wherefore he dieth nor, but the <hi>Pygmies</hi> do: nevertheleſs they are both ſubject to a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and everlaſting death, and are both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of everlaſting life: wherefore whoſoever giveth or ſubſcribeth himſelf unto them, the ſame event happeneth unto him as to them: Let every one therefore have a ſpecial care unto himſelf, and conſider well what he doth, before he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth himſelf; for he ſuddenly doth that whereby he ſhall alwayes be compelled to be obedient unto them, and to fulfill all their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; And if he ſhall chance to be diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto them, or anger them, they very much impaire, or totally deſtroy and take away his life: there have been found many examples of this kinde, to wit, ſometimes men have been found dead, their neckes turned about, or otherwiſe miſerably handled: where any ſuch thing hath happened, it hath hitherto commonly been ſaid,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170095:40"/>
that the Devil hath done this for this cauſe, either that the man hath not kept his promiſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact with him, or that the time which he cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted and ſubſcribed himſelf unto him for, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired; and that now he receiveth his laſt reward. But theſe opinions do not proceed from the fountaine of truth: for the office of the Devil containeth no ſuch thing in his power, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſuggeſteth unto men, evil thoughts and Cogitations, whereby he draweth them away from obeying the will and commandments of God; by which means he maketh them to be the greateſt ſinners, and to forget and deny God their Creator: and afterwards draweth them into deſpaire, ſo that they cannot any more be able to pray unto God: wherefore the Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Spirits are moſt like unto the devil, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are executioners of the wrath and vengeance of God; nevertheleſs they do often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo admoniſh and warne us, and do watch over us and defend us from many dangers, and ſometimes do deliver ſome from priſon, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to men many other helps.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore ſuch men as are burdened and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmed with grief and ſorrowful Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are not to be left alone, but ought to be entertained with various and pleaſant diſcourſe, which may delight their mindes, and expel their ſorrow: The Devils likewiſe are in theſe caſes not idle; but as buſie as thoſe terrene Spirits, &amp; do eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tempt ſuch kinde of men. From hence it comes to paſs, that ſome people, eſpecially women in child-bed, have been ſo oppreſſed in the night in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170095:40"/>
their ſleepe, that they have thought themſelves to be as it were ſtrangled, neither could they poſſibly cry out, or call any helpe, but in the Morning have reported that they were Ridden by a hag: And they are ſtill accounted to be witches, or Inchanters that do this; whereas their bodies cannot poſſibly enter into the chambers, where the doores and Windowes are ſhut; but the <hi>Sylphes</hi> and <hi>Nymphes</hi> eaſily can.</p>
                  <p>O thou of little faith! as doubtful as <hi>Peter,</hi> who ſuffereſt thy ſelf to be toſſed with every winde, and art eaſily drowned: thou thy ſelf art the cauſe hereof, by reaſon of thy little, dubious, and weake faith; alſo thy evil thoughts do draw thee unto this: Thou haſt alſo in thy ſelf a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Magnes that attracteth every like. This is the Celeſtial Load-ſtone above all others, which attracteth Iron and ſteel, above the Quinteſſence and ſtarry Magnes, which maketh the dejected and hidden Iron to appear: for the Celeſtial Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is of ſuch power and virtue, that from the diſtance of a hundred thouſand miles, even from any place whatſoever, from the four Elements, he attracteth the Iron to himſelf, when he paſſeth into his own exaltation. But this we ſhall make more largely to appear, in two excellent examples following.</p>

                  <head>Of the Imagination, and how the ſame cometh into it's exaltation.</head>
                  <p>WHat powerful operation the Imagination hath, and how the ſame cometh to its hight and exaltation, may be ſeen by an example taken from experience in the time of peſtilence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Imagination poyſoneth more then any infected Aire; and againſt which, no Antidote, neither of Mithridate nor Treacle, nor any ſuch preſervative, can exhibit any helpe; unleſs that ſuch an Imagination do paſs away and be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, nothing elſe will helpe. So quick and ſwift a Runner and Meſſenger is the Imagination, that it doth not onely fly out of one houſe into another, out of one ſtreete into another, but alſo moſt ſwiftly paſſeth from one City and Country into another; ſo that by the Imagination onely of one perſon, the Peſtilence may come into ſome whole City or Country, and kill many thouſands of men: as may be underſtood by this example. Put caſe there were two brethren dearly loving one another, and one of them lives in <hi>France</hi> and the other travels into <hi>Italy,</hi> who is taken away by the Peſtilence in the middle way, and newes ſhould be brought to the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther living in <hi>France,</hi> that his brother in <hi>Italy</hi> was dead of the Plague; at which he being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, it pierceth through his Skin, into his Imagination, ſo that he cannot forget it; and it is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170095:41"/>
kindled in him, and this fire doth ſo long rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate and worke, as it may be ſeen in the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of Gold and Silver, which do ſend forth their flowers ſo long, until they ſhine bright again; which is not before they are perfectly cleare, and ſeparated from the other impure Metals: After the ſame manner alſo the Imagination ſtriketh backe, and worketh it ſelf unto the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, after there will be a relucency thereof, now it is received in a veſſel in the man, as the ſperme of a man is received in the Matrix of the woman, whereby the conception of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man immediately follows. So doth the Peſtilence go from one to another, ſo long till it ſpread o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a whole City or Country: Ir is good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to keep far off; not becauſe of any corrupt or infected Aire, for it infects not the Aire, (as ſome Ignorant people ſay) but that they may not ſee or heare the operations of the Peſtilence, which may infect their mindes. But thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to whom any ſuch newes is reported as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, ought not to be left alone, neither muſt they be ſuffered to muſe ſilently with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whereby the Imagination may labour in their mindes; but they are to be comforted, and the Imagination is to be expelled from their mindes, by exciting them to mirth and joy: Neither let any think that I ſpeak this as a fable. as though it ſhould ſeem to be a light buſineſs; neither is the remedy ſo eaſie for oppreſt Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations; for the Imagination is as it were pitch, which eaſily cleaveth and ſticketh, and ſoone taketh fire, which being kindled, is not ſo eaſily
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170095:42"/>
extinguiſhed: wherefore the onely remedy to reſiſt the Peſtilence in ſuch men, is to quench and expel the force of the Imagination. This is one example wherein the power and operation of the Imagination is declared, with the exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof.</p>
                  <p>But now to ſpeake of another example, know, that the Imagination doth not onely operate on men in time of Peſtilence, and to deprive many of their lives, but alſo in war: how many have periſhed in war with the feare of the ſhot? the cauſe of whoſe death hath been onely their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination which they have had unto their death: That is, they have been ſo greatly overwhelmed with feare, and ſo terrified at every ſhot, that they have thought no otherwiſe but that they ſhould be wounded with every dart: ſuch men are far oftner ſlaine then thoſe that are bold, who go couragiouſly and without feare againſt their enemies; they feare no ſhot or wound, but have a firm faith and hope of Victory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the other Souldiers; ſuch are ſtout and true Souldiers: how many Towers, Caſtles, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes and Countryes have ſuch warred againſt, and overcome and Vanquiſhed the people there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? But the other that are fearful, whether they be great or little, Noble or Ignoble, Knights, Earls, or others, do ſcarce deſerve a halfe-peny to go againſt an enemy, much leſs any wages. Wherefore it becometh him that deſireth to be an old Souldier, or to gain Knight-hood or any honour in war, to fix and faſten his minde and Imagination firmly upon ſome moſt excellent
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170095:42"/>
ſtout Head and leader of an Army, ſuch as <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and many amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> have been; and by ſo doing, if he know how to uſe this Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination well, and be of a firm and conſtant minde, and as he if would attain to and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh all the heroick noble acts of ſuch a man; he ſhall not onely attain to be an old Souldier, but ſhall accompliſh his deſires in attaining to the like honours.</p>
                  <p>This hath ſuddenly happened to many who have followed the proceſs of their Imagination, ſo that they have attained to great honour and Riches.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But ſome may Object, that fortune, ſtrength and induſtry hath helped them, and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch men; alſo, that ſome have worne herbs, rootes and ſtones,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by reaſon of the virtue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they could not be overcome nor wounded.</hi>

                  <head>Of treaſure and Riches hid under the Earth.</head>
                  <p>WE ſhall declare ſomthing concerning Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures hid under the Earth; and ſhew ſome meanes whereby they are known and gotten. And alſo what things, ſomtimes evil, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, do happen about them.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing to be treated of, ſhall be the ſignes whereby they are known, that it may be certainly made manifeſt, and not out of meere opinion onely.</p>
                  <p>Note that it cometh to paſs, where ſuch places are, that there do appear many Phantaſmes, and ſomtimes immoderate ſtrange noiſes are heard, wherewith they that go out in the night are ſtrucke with terror and feare; ſo that ſomtimes they are caſt into a cold ſweate, and their haire of their head ſtands upright, which for the moſt part happens on the Sabbath night. Alſo if any lights do appear and ſeem to fall about thoſe places, and there their light is extinguiſhed and goeth out; and ſomtimes there ſeeme to be great flaſhes of wind in their houſe whoſe the treaſure is, and where it is hid; and there are ſeene many viſions and ſtrange Phantaſies: and many ſtrange Rumors and noiſes are there heard. Where ſuch things happen, they are heard and do ſhew themſelves moſt commonly about the middle time of the night: And the cauſe of theſe noiſes and ſights are, commonly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170095:43"/>
that there is treaſure hid, in or about that place, neither is there any other reaſon thereof to be given. Nevertheleſs many who have not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood theſe things, have had many various opinions hereof.</p>
                  <p>Some have thought that theſe Phantaſies have been cauſed by the devil, or by ſome Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or by ſome in that houſe who have ſome worke or famliarity with the Devil, or who have given or bound themſelves to the devil, or have made ſome promiſe unto him, whereby it comes to paſs that that wicked and malignant accuſer cauſeth theſe things to be ſeene and heard, that they might expect the expiration of their dayes, which he doth ſo much deſire ſhould be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>
                  <p>Others do believe, that ſome have been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly died and buryed there; others do thinke that ſome wicked man hath died in that place, whoſe Spirit hath been forced to wander there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts: and there have been other various and ſundry opinions.</p>
                  <p>But all theſe Judgements are vaine and falſe, except onely thoſe who conclude that the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the noiſes are, that there is treaſure hid about that place; or that ſometimes when the devil hath been driven out of ſom body that he hath poſſeſſed, he hath been permitted to ſtay about that place: but where thoſe noiſes are, it is a great Teſtimony that there is treaſure hid there.</p>
                  <p>There are two kinds of treaſures hid; ſome that may be found, and ſome that cannot be gotten;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170095:44"/>
the difference whereof is this: ſuch is eaſie to be found, which containeth the Metals of Gold and ſilver, and are ſuch kinde as we make, and have onely been uſed and handled amongſt men: that kinde of treaſure is not eaſie to be found, which is Gold and ſilver, that is made, coyned, and hid by the <hi>Nymphes</hi> and <hi>Sylphes;</hi> which kinde of Gold and ſilver doth ſomtimes come to be found and uſed amongſt men, and is by the <hi>Nymphes</hi> ſuddenly again buryed in the earth, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards cannot eaſily be found and gotten again.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things are moſt worthy our knowledge, eſpecially the ſignes before ſpoken of are moſt diligently to be noted; becauſe there are Magical Rods, which are deceitful, and are too eaſily inclinable to bend to any money that is let fall or loſt.</p>
                  <p>There are other viſions alſo which appeare in looking-glaſſes, Chriſtals, and ſuch like things, which Nigromancers that dig treaſures do uſe: but they are all falſe and deceitful; wherefore there is little credit to be given unto them.</p>
                  <p>We come now to ſpeake of the manner of digging for treaſure, how a time may be taken that we may have a happy progreſs in the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, which is as followeth. Firſt, under an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the <hi>Moone</hi> or <hi>Saturn,</hi> and when the <hi>Moone</hi> tranſits <hi>Taurus, Capricorne</hi> or <hi>Virgo,</hi> is a good time to begin to ſeeke or dig after trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Neither need you uſe any other Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, nor to draw any Circles, or to uſe any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments whatſoever; onely thoſe that dig muſt be of a cheereful minde, free and aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170095:44"/>
from any evil thoughts or cogitations, and not to be moved, nor feare any phantaſies, viſions, or Imaginations of the Spirits: although they ſhould corporally appeare, yet they are onely viſions. Therefore thoſe that dig ought to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſing, and be cheereful, and not to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted at any thing, but to have a good courage: And by no meanes ſoever let them keepe ſilence, as ſome perfidious Negromancers have taught.</p>
                  <p>Now when they come neere to the place where the Treaſure is, that it is almoſt detected, and do heare many noiſes; and ſtrange viſions and horible ſights are ſeene, which oftentimes happens to be: It ſheweth that the <hi>Pygmies</hi> and <hi>Sylphes</hi> are there, who do envy that men ſhould have thoſe treaſures; and will not willingly part from them, eſpecially if it be their own, or ſuch as they brought thither. Such treaſures are to be left, if the keepers thereof conſent not. And although they may be gotten and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as a Robbery from thoſe keepers, yet theſe keepers have an Art whereby they can change theſe treaſures, in this way gained, into a vile and baſe matter, as into earth, clay, dung, and ſuch-like things, (as I have ſeene by examples:) wherefore when any ſuch tranſmutations happen, we are not therefore to deſpaire in our mindes, although we find nothing like either Gold or ſilver, neither would any one ſuppoſe any ſuch thing to be there. We ought therefore to fly to the holy Scripture, which ſaith thus, God ſhall judge the world by fire; and in the Pſalmes thus,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170095:45"/>
Gold and ſilver are tryed in the fire, and are found pure and cleane: wherefore in any ſuch tranſmutations, the fire ought to be the judge; the proceeding in the tryal thereof, ought to be after the ſame manner, as the refining and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating of minerals and Metals; And by this meanes, it will be forced of neceſſity to return to the ſame eſſence which it had before.</p>
                  <p>There is another thing remarkeable in theſe kindes of tranſmutations; for ſomtimes the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are deluded, and there are found oftentimes pots of earth, full of braſs, ridiculous things and matter, as bones, egge-ſhells, pieces of wood, and ſuch things, which have been buryed there many years before. And they that have found the ſame, have ſuppoſed it to be the true treaſure, Gold or Silver, and to have been changed by the evil Spirits; which is falſe. For treaſure found ſuddenly and unſought for, cannot be changed by the Spirits, but remaineth in the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which it had before. Therefore theſe things are not to be accounted a tranſmutation, but rather a vexation: for ſomtime theſe vexers of men do bury ſuch things, that they which ſeeke after the treaſure might labour in vaine: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch things are not to be regarded, which are of no worth, and may eaſily be known by the lightneſs of their weight; But if they be of a heavy and ponderous body, like to a Mineral or Mineral ſand, there may an experiment thereof be made by fire.</p>
                  <p>That we may omit nothing that may conduce hereunto, we will adde alſo this objection.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170095:45"/>
Some may aske, How comes it to paſs that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is ſomtime eaſily found which is not ſought after? The cauſe whereof we may ſuppoſe to be this. Thoſe Spirits which are the keepers of treaſures, do beſt know the mindes, thoughts, and cogitations of men: therefore becauſe they know, that men have not any thoughts or will to dig or ſeeke after any treaſures in ſuch a place, they give no diligence to keepe the ſame, neither do they ſuſpect it; whereby it comes to paſs, that it is eaſily taken from them. It happeneth to them, as it doth to thoſe men who ſuddenly get ſome prey from their enemies, they not thinking of them, whereby the are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overcome, or ſpoiled by them. There are two cauſes chiefly why treaſures are ſo greedily ſought after by men. The firſt is the Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them who thirſt after riches; &amp; the other, that thoſe places where the treaſures are, might be afterwards made habitable, ſecure, ſafe, and quiet from being infeſted or moleſted with ſuch Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. For there are at this day many ancient houſes and Caſtles which are inhabitable, by reaſon of theſe kinde of Spirits: and the chiefe cauſe thereof is, that there are great treaſures hid about theſe places. In thoſe places where ſuch things happen, it is chiefly neceſſary that great care be taken in the digging thereabout; not ſo much for the money and treaſure, as that the place may again be made quiet and habitable. When any one goeth about this worke with diligent digging, one of theſe things common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happens; either the treaſure is found, or
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170095:46"/>
carried deeper in the earth, or removed by the keepers to ſome other place; as viſions in pure Chriſtals have often ſhewn, and as they have told the diggers: I now ſee many <hi>Pygmies,</hi> take the treaſure quite away. Credit ought to be given hereunto, and the digging to ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>It is further to be known, by how much the greater noiſes are heard about the place, and ſights and viſions ſeen, by ſo much greater the treaſure is to be judged to be, and neerer to the ſuperficies of the earth.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of thoſe that are poſſeſſed of malignant Spirits, and of the Devil.</head>
                  <p>AFter what manner men are poſſeſſed and overcome by the Devil, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> largely writeth and declareth unto us: But that the words of his admonition may be underſtood according to the true ſence thereof, a little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is needful: For the Apoſtle briefly and ſummarily comprehendeth the whole matter in two words, to wit, faſting and prayer: Theſe ſeem to be very little and light things at the firſt ſight; nevertheleſs they are of very great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſignifie very many things, if they be conſidered rightly and attentively: When therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth ſo earneſtly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh us, ſaying, Be ye ſober and watch: for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170095:46"/>
your enemy the Devil goeth about as a raging Lion, ſeeking whom he may devoure; Afterwards he concludeth, that by faith we may be able to reſiſt the Devil; therefore <hi>Peter</hi> would have us to underſtand his firſt word of Sobriety, ſo, as if he ſhould ſay, Beware of all kinde of glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony and drunkenneſs.</p>
                  <p>For drunkenneſs is the fountain and original of all evils and vices, which are acted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated by drunkards through the perſwaſions of the Devil: wherefore obſerve a mean in meat and drinke, leſt your hearts be troubled and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened therewith; for the Devil is alway pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, although inviſible; he is a Spirit, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth all Arts, and can be in what place he will, throughout the Circuit of the whole earth: he is the author and Actor of all evil and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs which is done by men in the whole earth; he is as watchful over mankinde, as a Cat is over a mouſe: wherefore he ſeduceth you unawares, when you have filled your ſelves with wine; and then filleth up all vices in you: he then compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth you about with his ſnares and bonds, as the hang-man doth evil-doers and malefactors, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he hath killed them; ſo alſo doth he with thoſe that are drunke; beſieging them with ſnares and Temptations, untill he either hath deſtroyed their bodyes, or brought them into deſpair.</p>
                  <p>Take heed to your ſelves therefore, Oh you Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures and drunkards, and alſo Souldiers, who are always filled with wine night and day. Therefore a ſouldier that ſo overchargeth himſelf with meat
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170095:47"/>
or drinke, ought to be accounted brutiſh as ſwine, ſeeing both of them are Ignorant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain of the time of their death, or how ſoone they may be ſlaine.</p>
                  <p>This is the meaning of the firſt word of St. <hi>Peter</hi> of Soberneſs: now we come to underſtand what he meaneth by watching.</p>
                  <p>By watching <hi>Peter</hi> ſeemeth to underſtand, as if he ſhould ſay, Walke in uprightneſs and juſtice; be of good courage, not faint-hearted; caſt away all evil thoughts and cogitations, and all Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies of the Devil, that ſuch Imaginations may not have any place with you; For hereby many have been overwhelmed and beſieged by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the reaſon whereof hath been their own wicked and evil thoughts and Imaginations. Therefore relinquiſh and caſt them all away, and have God always before your eyes; pray unto him, and let him be onely in your thoughts; make your ſelves like unto him and his children, and then he will ſend you his holy Spirit, who will guard you, rule you, and declare the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful workes of his mercy by you, as he hath done by <hi>Paul</hi> and all the other Apoſtles, who have been all after this manner preſerved by his holy Spirit; follow them therefore, and exclude and caſt away the Devil and all evil cogitations, and wicked thoughts, wherewith we may alſo ſeduce and deceive our ſelves, and thereby at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and draw the devil into us, and be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally beſieged and poſſeſſed by him, and ſo come into deſperation, that we may deſtroy our own lives; even as did <hi>Judas, Achitophel,</hi> and many others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:170095:47"/>Thus much of watching, &amp; the interpretation thereof, which <hi>Peter</hi> would have to be underſtood thereby. For by watching he doth not mean ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from the bed and ſleep, as the <hi>Carthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and other <hi>Monaſteries</hi> do teach and obſerve; for God created and ordained reſt and ſleepe, and firſt ſuffered it to enter into <hi>Adam.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every one ought to ſleepe in due ſeaſon, as much as his nature requireth, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, note how <hi>Peter</hi> concludeth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth his word from God, ſaying, Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the devil by faith; as if he ſhould ſay, Do not in any wiſe ſticke or ſtumble at the word of God, or doubt of his mercy; do you not burden your conſcience, nor trouble your hearts; do not perſwade your ſelves that God regardeth you not, or that he is forgetful of you; or that he accounteth you unworthy of his mercy, ſo that you ought not to come unto him, becauſe you have acted againſt his Divine will, or have broken his commandments, and committed many ſins: But rather, firmly believe his word, that Chriſt would not the death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould be converted, and live: Alſo, that he came into the world becauſe of our ſins, that he might take them from us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf; which alſo he hath done: there are many ſuch comfortable words to be found in the Holy Scriptures, which ought to be propoſed to ſuch perſons as are weake in their faith, for their comfort and conſolation: After this manner a man reſiſteth an evil conſcience and the Devil, ſo that he is freed from them, and not tempted any more.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the manner of delivering them that are poſſeſt by evil Spirits, and the great abuſe which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hath been committed by many, in ſuch kinde of buſineſs.</head>
                  <p>NOw to come to ſpeake of the driving away of evil Spirits; it is to be known, that very few ſince the times of Chriſt and his Apoſtles have rightly been driven away. For they knew not how to uſe any other meanes but Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes and Conjurations, wherewith they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to expel the malignant Spirits and the devil; whereas this is altogether a falſe founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by no meanes to be followed or imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated. Although ſometimes ſome have been delivered by this way, and the devil hath been driven from them; nevertheleſs it hath not been done, neither can it be done without loſs: Like as if a Prince would vanquiſh ſome Country or City, with the Sword, this he could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly do without ſome apparent damage and loſs to that place. A common proverb hereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to minde, which ſaith, That he that cannot get good words from good men, ſhall much leſs wreſt them from evil men, although they be compelled by force: the more evil is to be feared, as by examples is too often ſeen to come to paſs.</p>
                  <p>Therefore that opinionated power is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170095:48"/>
which is uſed in Ceremonies and Conjurations. But you ought to expell wicked Spirits as Chriſt and his Apoſtles did, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way: But if you do otherwiſe, you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take great Labours againſt the Devil: for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Devil is forced through great difficulty to go out of men, and ſeeketh all iniquities and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked occaſions to ſtay, and retain them in his power. But when he ſeeth that he can no longer ſtay, and remain in the poſſeſſed, but is forced to go out, then he requireth power and licence to enter into ſome other man, or beaſt, or into ſome other place: which if he be permitted, there followeth a greater loſs thereupon.</p>
                  <p>Therefore there is no other place to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted or aſſigned unto him, but hell, from whence he cometh, and which God hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him, and caſt him into; that it may not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, as we have an example (as we faithfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) when Chriſt permitted the devil which he caſt out of the man, to enter into the herd of ſwine, which no ſooner had the devil entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, but they were drowned in the Sea. Therefore they are in no wiſe to be permitted to enter into any other men, leſt ſuddenly after they deprive them of their lives, as they did theſe ſwine: Neither are they to be permitted to go into any Rivers, lakes, or ponds; which if it ſhould be done, they will drown many men therein, and draw them into the deepe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe waters; and will deride them as a fool doth his maſter with his fingers; and therewith the devils are more delighted then before: neither
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170095:49"/>
ought they to have any power given them, or to their deſires to go into any houſe or Caſtle; for they will perpetually poſſeſs it, and will ſo reigne there, that no body will any more be able to dwell or inhabit in that place, but they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way be inhabitable, as many both houſes and Caſtles are in many Countries, which are left de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate for this very cauſe; many whereof I could name in this place, but I paſs them by, to avoyd prolixity: let Satan therefore aske what he will, where, or to what place he would go, nothing elſe ought to be granted to him, then to return into hell, which God ordained for him, and thruſt him into: from whence he came into the man, and into which he ought to enter when he goeth out of the man, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Alſo if the devil ſhall cauſe the man to ſpeake many vaine trifles, we ought not to anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, or to ſpeake much with him: But if any one will ſpeake with him, let him ſay, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee, Oh thou unclean Spirit, by the word, power and virtue whereby thou wert caſt out by Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, that thou go out of this man, &amp;c. He is no other way to be conjured; neither are theſe words to be taken for a Conjuration, but for an anſwer, by which alone he is not caſt out: but this is firſt to be done, to wit, to watch and pray; for Chriſt ſaith, This kinde is onely to be caſt out by faſting and prayer with faith.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore it is chiefly neceſſary to induce and force ſuch as are thus poſſeſt, to prayer; though it be very difficult to be done, becauſe the devil ſo Ruleth their tongues, that he ſuffereth
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170095:49"/>
them not to pray: Therefore there muſt be prayers made before them; and if they will not pray with and after thoſe that are praying, they muſt be more ſharply dealt withall; That is to ſay, the poſſeſſed muſt be faſt bound both his hands and feete, and afterwards let ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man lie acroſs over them, and ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be very angry with them, and ſeverely compel them to prayer: but he ought to pray be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and to exhort them to pray after him the ſame words. By this meanes ſuch people may be induced to pray, when they cannot be brought to it by any other meanes; which ought to be continued day by day, and the devil will go out of them and leave them. This ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoken concerning the caſting out of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane and evil Spirits, becauſe I am reſtrained to uſe brevity in other places.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of Tempeſts</head>
                  <p>THat we may now come to ſpeak of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Tempeſts, &amp; how they may be expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led away; Alſo how and by what meanes any one may preſerve himſelf and his from Thunder, lightning and haile: We ſhall declare in the firſt place, that all Tempeſts do proceed from the four Capital windes, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Eaſt, South, Weſt,</hi> and <hi>North:</hi> Then from the Centre of both,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170095:50"/>
that is to ſay, of the Aire and Firmament, there are no tempeſts can ariſe; But from the four Fountaines before ſpoken of, which comes chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore he that deſires to preſerve his goods, Houſe, Lands, garden, field, meadow, and ſuch things from all manner of thunder, haile and Tempeſt; he ought firſt to know theſe things, whereby he may alſo know how to aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late inferiours to Superiours. We will therefore in this place briefly declare the original of all Tempeſts.</p>
                  <p>The original of tempeſts is certainly nothing elſe, but the appearance of Spirits; and lightning or corruſcation preceding, is the preſence of them: whereby it may be certainly known, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe tempeſts will paſs away with or without danger; and that after this manner is to be underſtood; to wit, as a ſtranger will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into any ones houſe, unleſs firſt he ſpeake, ſo theſe Spirits do not appeare unto us without ſpeaking firſt. But their voice is thunder, which as we ſee immediately follows every flaſh of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Alſo if a ſtranger ſhould ſuddenly fly into the houſe of another, where he is not known; it ſeems to ſignifie no good, but evil rather; either he himſelf is proſecuted by others, or elſe brings ſome damage to them. So likewiſe are we to underſtand of the lightning of heaven; the more quick it comes, the more dangerous it is, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſome Thunder-bolt followes. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very neceſſary to know how every one may defend and ſave himſelf herefrom, that he fall not
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170095:50"/>
into ſome place that he would not, or receive ſome other hurt: the Ringing of Bells do availe nothing in theſe caſes; although I do not reject them, eſpecially in ſuch tempeſts as are cauſed by Magicians inchantments, by reaſon of the Spirits by them raiſed in the Aire. For the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits do love ſilence and quietneſs, whereby it comes to paſs that great noiſes, as the ſounds of bells and Trumpets, do partly diminiſh and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe tempeſts by them ſtirred up: But in Thunders and haile they do no good, as the Monks and Sacrificers have to their loſs too often found. And for this cauſe they uſed ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, wherewith they ſeduced the Vulgar and common people, perſwading them that beſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling places with holy water (as they call it) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them ſafe from Thunder and haile; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by burning holy candles, or ſome palme, or other herb by them ſanctified, or with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume of Frankincenſe, or Myrrhe of theſe ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers they were preſerved ſecure.</p>
                  <p>O thou fool, and unwiſe ſacrificer and Monk, who art hitherto Ignorant of theſe things; and underſtandeſt them not, in this place thou mayſt be taught the contrary; how that Malignant Spirits are not driven away with ſweet perfumes, but are mightily delighted therwith, and do run more freely &amp; ſwiftly to them, then to ſtinking ſmells; whether they be good Spirits or evil. But if in ſtead of Frankincenſe and Myrrhe, you had taught to have made a fumigation of <hi>Aſſa Fetida,</hi> you might therewith drive away both good and evil Spirits: For the good odour of Frankincenſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170095:51"/>
and Myrrh is nothing elſe but the ſacrifice of the Spirits, wherewith we attract and draw them unto us. But of this we have ſpoken enough.</p>
                  <p>Now to return to that which we intended to write of; and firſt, how any place may be preſerved from Thunder and haile: note therefore, that to place a preſervative in the centre of a houſe, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or field, &amp;c. availeth not at all; but at the four Angles, <hi>Eaſt, Weſt, South,</hi> and <hi>North;</hi> then the place ſhall be ſecured: as a building ſet upon four Pillars is more ſtrong and firme then that which is founded onely upon one, which is ſet in the middle of the centre, or ſome other place: this is more eaſily overthrown by the winde or Spirits. Now the materials which belong to this preſervative, and of which theſe four pillars are made, note that they conſiſt of ſimple bodies, every one whereof is ſufficient, and hath ſtrength and virtue in it ſelf for the effects before ſpoken of: As Mugwort, St <hi>John</hi>'s wort, Perewincle, Celandine, Rue, Devils bit, and many ſuch herbs and roots, and eſpecially if they be gathered and taken in the right influence.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo other things of far greater ſtrength and vertue; as Coral, Azoth; and one of the Characters before ſpoken of being drawn in a certain table, or ingraven: In theſe three things is a great ſecret againſt all Inchantments and workes of witches and the Devil himſelf. In which preſervatives we may truſt in our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt neceſſities.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the great abuſe of the Magicke Art by them that uſe it for Negromancy and Witch-craft.</head>
                  <p>THe Magicke Art in it ſelf, is the moſt ſecret and occult ſcience of all ſupernatual things in the world: That thoſe things which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be ſearched out by humane reaſons, by this Art, to wit, Magick, it may be found out and known: wherefore it is the moſt occult and ſecret wiſedom; and reaſoning againſt it, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but extream folly. It were therefore very neceſſary that the Divines would learn to know ſomething of this Art, and be experienced in Magick what it is; and not ſo unworthily, without any ground at all, to call it Witchcraft. The Magical ſcience were very profitable for them to know, ſeeing they will undertake to be the Maſters and teachers of the holy Scriptures, and perſwade themſelves to be ſo: Not that I would have them uſe the Magical Art, or operate any thing by it; but to be expert therein, and to know the virtues and effects thereof, for the high and great myſterious ſecrets which are hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the holy Scriptures, delivered by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, Prophets, and Chriſt himſelf; and which we by our humane reaſon cannot underſtand nor ſearch out.</p>
                  <p>What Divine that is Igrorant of Magicke,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170095:52"/>
can caſt out the Devil, drive away or binde a Spirit, or that can call one unto him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him to come? or that which is far leſs, can he heale the ſick, or adminiſter any other help to him by his faith alone? I wil be ſilent of his remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a mountain into the Sea. There followeth then that faith whereof Chriſt ſpeaketh, of which they underſtand neither much nor little: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs they make a great ſhew and profeſſion thereof with their mouthes, and do teach and ſpeake much thereof; but themſelves know not how to make proofe thereof, or to give any ſigne thereof, by their faith, whereby it may be ſaid that they underſtand this faith, and to make uſe of it in the proofe thereof. But if any one ſhould come, who by his faith and Magicke ſhould perform a good ſigne, you having not the reaſon of knowing whether it be good or evil, will forthwith call him a Negromancer and Witch, becauſe he hath done ſomething above your reaſon and humane wiſdom; when you your ſelves cannot tell how to diſcerne a Negroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer or Witch, from a Magician.</p>
                  <p>Magicke is therefore a moſt neceſſary and pure Art; not defiled nor corrupted with any Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies or Conjurations, as Nigromancy: For in Magicke there is no uſe of Ceremonies, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrations, Conjurations, Bleſſings or Curſes; but of faith alone whereof Chriſt ſpeaks, ſaying, that by it we ſhall be able to remove Mountains and caſt them into the Sea; And to compel, looſe, and binde all Spirits: This is the true founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Inſtrument of Magicke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:170095:52"/>Truely therefore it is a thing chiefly neceſſary to looke into this ART, that it be not turned into ſuperſtition and abuſe, and to the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or damage of men; and hereby it is made Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gromancy, and Witch-craft; and at length, not undeſervedly, ſo called by all men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Witches and Sorcerers have violently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded themſelves into the Magicke Art, like Swine broke into a delicate Garden. So is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke corrupted and made Nigromancy by theſe perfidious men; wherefore it hath not unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly been burnt in the fire with theſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Sorcerers. For theſe kinde of men are the moſt nocent and hurtful, and the worſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to mankinde, that they have not worſe enemies in all the world, which proſecute them with a more deadly hatred: from a preſent pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique enemy, and corporal perſecuter, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoreth to invade us with the moſt cruel wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, Guns, or Darts; we may beware of ſuch a one, or take up Arms againſt him for our defence, with Brigandines or Darts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or elſe a man may tarry in his houſe, and keep himſelf, ſuffering none to enter in but his Friends. But of theſe Witches and Sorcerers, no man can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware or defend himſelf, becauſe againſt this kind of Enemies of God and men, no Weapons, Coats of Mayl or Brigandines will help, no ſhutting of doors, or locks; for they penetrate through all things, and all things are open unto them. And if any one were incloſed in Towers of Iron or Braſs, he would not thereby be ſecured from theſe enemies; Although in their own proper
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170095:53"/>
bodies they ſeldom bring hurt to any one, but raiſe up, and ſend Spirits unto them, by their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Faith, and hurt them in ſome part of their bodies, although they are abſent from them an hundred miles diſtance; they either ſmite, wound, or kill them, although no outward and external wound can be ſeen appear: becauſe they cannot hurt the outward man, but only the internal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Wherefore no Coats of Mayl can defend them, be they never ſo good; but they muſt put on other weapons and fortifications, to wit, the Armor of Faith: This is the true way, and then let him be clothed with a Linen garment, the wrong end turned upwards: and after that hath been often worn, thou ſhalt be more ſafely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, than if thou wert armed and girt with all manner of weapons.</p>
                  <p>Although there are many preſervatives which will keep and defend men from all theſe Faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Witchcrafts which are wrought by the ariſing of theſe evil Spirits, ſuch as are Coral, Azoth, and the like, which being uſed according to their due uſe and order, will well preſerve from theſe enormities before ſpoken of. For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and preſervation from them is eaſie, but the cure is difficult; nevertheleſs it is poſſible: But in ſuch caſes, the proceeding thereunto muſt be magical and ſupernatural: From thence ſprung that ſaying which ſome uſe, That none can better help the bewitched, than them that hurt them: This is a true ſaying which cannot be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted: but they which uſe it, underſtand not the Cauſe of this thing, neither can they give any
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170095:53"/>
reaſon thereof, why Witches do beſt of all, moſt happily, readily, and ſurely help, and Cure the bewitched: Therefore of this thing you ſhall be here ſufficiently inſtructed.</p>
                  <p>Some Witches make and form Images in the form and likeneſs of ſome man which they propoſe to themſelves, and conceive in their own minds; and do ſtick a nail in the ſole of his foot, and after this manner hurt the man, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly feeleth the pain of a nail in his foot, and is ſo tormented therewith, that he is not able to go, until the nail is pulled out of the foot of the Image; which being drawn away, the man is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: which no man knoweth better how to do, than he that fixed the nail in the Image; nor where it was fixed, or what the Cauſe of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe was.</p>
                  <p>It oftentimes alſo cometh to paſs, that after the ſame manner a nail is ſomtimes by theſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches fixed in the teeth of the Image of the man, ſo that afterwards he cannot take any reſt in his teeth, unleſs the nail be taken away, or his teeth drawn out: In like manner are nails ſtruck into any other members of the Image by theſe arch-Sorcerers, and hereby they hurt men without making any impreſſion or ſigne thereof upon their skin.</p>
                  <p>Oftentimes alſo it ſo happeneth to men, that there ariſe Tumors in their heads or elſewhere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their bodies, which are like Puſhes; or sky<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour ſpots, that appear ſuddenly and vex men in their bodies, as if they had been beaten with knotted Ropes: to whom any ſuch accident
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170095:54"/>
happeneth without any viſible blow or bruiſe to be perceived; he will not judge any otherwiſe, but that he is ſmitten by theſe Images.</p>
                  <p>It is too often ſeen to fall out, that a man ſometimes loſeth an Eye ſuddenly, or is ſtruck quite blind; or deaf in one, or both Ears; dumb, or ſome imperfection in his ſpeech; croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, lame, or dieth; all which accidents are wrought by Witches, through the divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: All which are Magical acceptions and torments, and are made and completed by the Aſcendants.</p>
                  <p>In theſe Caſes the Phyſitians ought to take heed, and be adviſed, that when they perceive ſuch kinds of Diſeaſes to be ſupernatural, that then they do not judge them to be natural Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and ſo think to Cure them with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Apothecaries Medicaments; For thereby they will reap nothing but diſgrace, which often happens to many of them: It is a croſs (ſay they) or affliction by God laid upon them, which no Phyſitian can help. Oh you Quackſalvers, it is not as you think, but indeed it is a chaſtiſement, by the permiſſion of God, wrought by Witches and evil men; wherefore the Phyſitian ought to conſider the Signs, whereby he may know, and judge of the Diſeaſe; and thereby may inform himſelf which way to effect the Cure thereof: And Medicines are to be uſed, and applied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place it is neceſſary that he ask the Patient, How, and in what manner the Diſeaſe took him, or happened unto him; what was
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170095:54"/>
the original of the evil, Whether it were occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by any fall, blow, thruſt, bruiſe; or if any other natural Cauſe can be perceived; or that there be any Flux, or inward corruption of blood: but if none of theſe ſigns appear, then let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain demand of the Patient, Whether he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny body in ſuſpition that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n enemy, or one not wiſhing well to him, that might be a Witch? If he anſwer that he hath ſome miſtruſt of any ſuch, then he ſhall judge that it hath happened to him as is above declared. Therefore it is moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the Phyſitian to underſtand rightly after what manner he is to deal with the Patient, if he deſire to be perfect in this art. But the Ancients have not written at all any thing concerning this kinde of Cure, neither <hi>Galen</hi> nor <hi>Avicenna,</hi> nor any other; we ſhall therefore lay down the manner of the Cure in Order, which follows.</p>
                  <p>They who are bewitched, cannot be Cured any better, than by hurting again the ſame place afflicted; that is, by making (through Faith and imagination) ſuch a like member as is hurt, or elſe a whole Image out of Wax, which he ſhall either anoint or binde up with Plaiſters, where the Tumors, Signs, or Spots be, is a preſent help for that perſon in whoſe name it ſhall be made; and the pain ſhall ceaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if he be ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, that he is in danger to loſe an eye, his hearing; or be impedited in the Generative fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of his privy Members, in his Speech, or hath his Members made crooked or wreathed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wry; then let there be made an Image of the whole body of Wax, with a firm Faith, upon
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170095:55"/>
which Image let the intent of your imagination be firmly fixed; and afterwards let the whole Image be conſumed with fire in due order. Make no wonder that people bewitched are thus eaſily Cured: neither be like the Sophiſters of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademies, who ſcoff and deride at ſuch things; and ſay, That they are impoſſibilities, and againſt God and Nature, becauſe they are not taught in their Schools.</p>
                  <p>It follows then, ſince they are true, That a Phyſitian ought not to reſt only in that bare knowledge which their Schools teach, but to learn of old Women, Egyptians, and ſuch-like perſons; for they have greater experience in ſuch things, than all Academians.</p>
                  <p>We come to ſpeak alſo of the Dartings and Jaculations of all Witches, as the Inchanters and Witches do call them; when they afflict any man, that they inſert aſhes, hairs, feathers, briſtles of Hogs, fins of Fiſhes, and ſuch like things into the foot, or ſome part of the body, without any opening of the skin.</p>
                  <p>But how, or after what manner this is done, we ſhall not here ſpeak of; left if it be known to ſome, it may be by them made uſe of to do evil; wherefore we ſhall paſs it over, it being only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to write of the manner of the Cure, that the ſame likewiſe may be effected without opening of the skin, and ſuch griefs taken away. The way and uſe of the Ancients in ſuch kinde of Cures, is eſpecially to be avoided, who uſed to lance the part affected with Razors, about the centre thereof, and that very deep, where there
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170095:55"/>
are no hairs, nor any thing elſe to be found; and by that way of proceeding, do afflict the Patients with moſt intolerable torments, as if they were racked in the hands of the hangman: for by this kinde of Remedy, very few are Cured, but many have thereby loſt their lives. Wherefore this proceeding is quite to be left, and a better to be choſen: which is: Let ſome quantity, the whole, or half, much or little, of the like injacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated matter, which may be found and buried ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in an Elder or Oak, and fixed with a wedge towards the Eaſt; which being done, there needs not any greater labor, for then that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains may be extracted from the body, and the Cure will follow without uſing any other Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: But it will be otherwiſe, if the extracted matter be not placed in a right place; whatſoever it be, it cauſeth hurt, and diminiſheth not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaculated matter. Wherefore it were to be wiſhed, that it might be extracted from the body of man, without labor or pain, without making any inciſion, combuſtion, or opening thereof: It is therefore eſpecially to be noted, that the ſame ought to be done by the virtue of the Magnes, (which attracteth all bewitched matter to it ſelf:) ſuch as is Oak-leaves, Celandine, Azoth, and powder of Coral: which if any one of them be by himſelf bound and faſtned about the Centre, in 24 hours it will extract from the body all ſuch matter, as by any ſuch means of Witchcraft is injaculated therein.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only add this one thing, which is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaying, uſed by many to ſay, I am an enemy
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170095:56"/>
to, and hate ſuch Witches and Sorcerers; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am ſure they cannot hurt me: And this is firmly believed by ſuch kinde of faithleſs and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant men, that thoſe Witches and Sorcerers that they hate, can do them no hurt; but only ſuch as they love, and give ſomthing to, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is falſe: for whoſoever they are that are their enemies, do alſo give them thereby an occaſion to uſe hatred and enmity towards them; and from that Spring at laſt ariſes the Perſecution, according to the manner, power, and proprieties of the enemies. But if we would reſiſt them that they cannot hurt us, we muſt do it by Faith; for that confirms and ſtrengthens all things, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth up, and caſteth down, and performeth all things.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170095:57"/>
duly prepared with the hand and art: which among many people, are held and accounted to be ſuperſtitious and wicked operations, and againſt nature; that they are idolatrous operations, and that the help of the Devil is uſed to bring them to perfection. They ſay, How can it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that Metals being engraven upon only with Characters, Letters and Words, ſhould have any ſuch power, unleſs they were prepared through the Craft and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Devil? To theſe we An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I hear you give Credit to them, and do believe that they have power and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, being prepared by the help of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and do operate through him; And are you not able alſo to believe that God, who is the Creator of the whole Work of Nature, hath as much power in Heaven, and alſo that he giveth power and virtue to thoſe operations in Metals, Herbs, Roots, Stones, and ſuch like things? But in your judgment you ſeem to make the Devil more wiſe and powerful, than the only Omnipotent Lord God, who of his great Mercy, hath Created all Metals, Herbs, Roots, Stones, and all things whatſoever, that live, or move, in, or upon the Earth, Water and Air; and hath
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170095:57"/>
endued them with their ſeveral degrees of virtue, for the benefit and uſe of mankind: It is alſo moſt certain, and approved by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience evidently, That the Changes and Mutations of time, have great and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtrength and operation; and that chiefly in Metals, which are made in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain determinate time, as it is manifeſt to many, and very well known to us by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry experiences. No man likewiſe can teach that Metals are dead ſubſtances, or do want life; ſeeing their oyls, ſalt, ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and quinteſſence are the greateſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatives, and have the greateſt ſtrength and virtue to reſtore and preſerve the life of man, before all other Simples, as we ſhall teach in all our Remedies aſſigned thereunto: Certainly if they had not life, how could they help Diſeaſes, and reſtore the decayed Members of the Body, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting life, and ſtirring up corporal vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them? as in Contractures, the Stone, Small-pox, Dropſie, Falling-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Phrenzy, Gout, and ſeveral other Diſeaſes, which for brevities ſake I omit to mention. Therefore I ſay, That Metals, Stones, Roots, Herbs, and all other Fruits have life in them, though of divers kinds, according to their Creation and growth,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170095:58"/>
and the due obſervation of the time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent thereunto. For the times have in them ſingular power and virtue; which manifeſtly appeareth, and may be proved by ſundry Arguments, which we ſhall not here produce, ſince they are ſo commonly known. For it is not our intent here to treat of things that are ſo cleerly known; but of more weighty and undiſcerned ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, which to ſence ſeem contrary.</p>
               <p>Characters, Letters, and Signes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have ſeveral virtues and operations; wherewith alſo the nature of Metals, the condition of Heaven, and the influence of the Planets, with their operations, and the ſignifications and proprieties of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, Signes, and Letters, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the times, do concur and agree together. Who can object that theſe Signs and Seals have not their virtue and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, one for infirmities in the head, being prepared in his time; another for the ſight; another for gravel in the Reins and Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but every one is to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his own proper time, and helpeth ſuch and ſuch infirmities, and no other; as drink is to be taken within the body, and not otherwiſe? but all this is to be done by means, by the help and aſſiſtance of the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170095:58"/>
Father of all Medicines, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, our only Savior.</p>
               <p>But if any one ſhall object, that Words and Characters have no virtue; and ſay as well as others, That they are of no more power than a bare Mark, or naked Croſs or Signe; Alſo, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, hath no more power in the Greek tongue, than in the German, but only ſignifies the death of a Serpent, or ſome ſuch thing: Let him tell me, who believeth ſuch things, from whence it comes to paſs, That Serpents in <hi>Helvetia,</hi> or <hi>Suevia,</hi> do underſtand theſe Greek words, <hi>Oſii, oſija, oſii;</hi> ſince the Greek tongue is not ſo vulgar in thoſe Countries, that venemous worms ſhould underſtand it, or in time learn it? How ſhould they come to underſtand them, or in what Univerſitie have they learned them, that as ſoon as ever they hear theſe words, they will immediately ſtop their eares with their tayles, that they may not hear them again? For no ſooner do they hear theſe words, but immediately they lie ſtill, contrary to their natures, not hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or offering to bite or caſt any venome at any man; and afterwards if they hear any man to approach towards them, they ſuddenly fly into their holes. If thou doſt
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170095:59"/>
ſay that nature doth effect this, it is the ſame which I did expect thou ſhouldeſt anſwer: but if Nature worketh this upon a Serpent, why doth ſhe not the ſame among all other Creatures? But if you ſhould ſay, That the noiſe of the mans voice ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth it, and that thereby the Serpents are terrified and ſtupified; or that it is done by any power in the man; why then do they not in the ſame manner lie ſtill when a man maketh a far greater noiſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crying out, or diſchargeth a Gun, or the like?</p>
               <p>Characters and Seals have likewiſe in them wonderful virtue, which is not at all contrary to nature, nor ſuperſtitious: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, if you ſay that words are of no effect, but as the bare voice of men; I ſay on the contrary, if you write the ſame words in Parchment, or Paper, in a ſelected time, and put it upon a Serpent that is taken, in what manner you will, he will remain and lie ſtill, as if you had ſpoken the ſame words.</p>
               <p>Neither is it any wonder, that Medicines can help men not taken into the body, but only hanged about the neck as Seals: For it is common to the Bladder with Cantharides, That it turneth his Urine

into Blood, that holdeth Cantharides cloſe in his hand, the Bladder holding the Urine, and containing it that it cannot paſs out of the Body, the hand being held far from the Body.</p>
               <p>Some Creatures do retain the ſame vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue after they are dead, as I prove by the Bird called the <hi>Kings Fiſher,</hi> whoſe skin being taken off from his carcaſe, and being dried, and hanged up upon a nail, will caſt his feathers many years, and new ones will grow again; and that not only for one or two yeers, but many yeers one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>But if you further enquire, out of what Author or Writer I read of theſe virtues, or where I learned ſuch experience; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer you Sophiſters and Contemners of the Gifts of God, that very Nature her ſelf demonſtrated before your eyes, doth far excel all the Authors and Writers of the world. I pray tell me which of your Authors or Writers taught the Bear, when his ſight is dimmed by reaſon of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and ſuperfluity of his blood, to go to a ſtall of Bees, which by their ſtinging him, pierce his skin, and cauſe an effuſion of the ſuperfluous blood? What Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian preſcribed the herb Dittany to be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170095:60"/>
for the Hart? or who taught the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent the virtue of Briony and Dragon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort? who taught the Dog to take Graſs for his Cordial and Purge? And who preſcribed the ſalt Sea-water to the Stork for a Clyſter? Did you teach this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to them? or do not they teach you? The ſame might I ſpeak of infinite other Animals, that know naturally the Cure of their own Diſeaſes. What! Have the Bruit-beaſts taught the Medicinal Art? If you ſay, It's a Natural inſtinct, and that Nature teacheth them, ſo ſay I too. If Nature hath infuſed ſo much reaſon into Bruit-beaſts, how much more ſhould men learn thereby, who are made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Image of God, the Creator of all things; and are indued with reaſon from God, to conſider and contemplate ſuch things?</p>
               <p>Alſo to ſay that things outwardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and not ſubſtantially entring into the body, cannot Cure any Diſeaſes, is falſe: For the Sun, which giveth us light, warmth, ſplendor, and infuſeth life into all things, penetrateth into the moſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and cloſe Manſions of the Earth; and doth vivifie and quicken all things that lie under the earth, even to the centre thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:170095:60"/>For who can deny that in Spring-time, eſpecially, the Sun penetrateth into the moſt ſecret places of the earth, giving heat and warmth thereunto, when it ſhines only upon the upper part thereof? From whence the roots of all things therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive juyce, ſtrength, and life? and why therefore may not the ſplendor of Nature, and the influences of the Heavens, Stars, Planets, and other means which we uſe to extract out of Metals, Herbs, Stones, and ſuch like things, give their virtue into the bodies of men, and penetrate into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and private members thereof? as into the Nervs, Veins, and other internal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects lurking in the fleſh and blood of men, and have been there a long time growing. Diſeaſes, Infirmities, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, are divers; ſo likewiſe are the ſeveral Cures thereof to be oppoſed to them according to their qualities, in their peculiar dayes and times: Againſt which alſo, Metals do beſt of all help; being prepared and uſed in due time and means: As if I ſhould undertake to Cure the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie with Gold; what ſhould hinder but that an Oyl made thereof may Cure it by Unction? Alſo, if I ſhould anoint the Small Pox with Oyl of Mercury, do you
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170095:61"/>
think I am able to Cure them with this Mercury? without doubt; eſpecially if I obſerve a fitting time for this purpoſe, without which laſt means, all anointings are in vain, although the ſick were bathed in Oyl of Mercury: But in ſuch Diſeaſes where the Mercurial medicines are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, we ought then to uſe other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: which unleſs I ſhould do, having a due reſpect to the obſervation of time, not only the Unctions, and all labor beſides, will be vain and fruitleſs, but they will bring the Patient into a worſe condition: for it is moſt certain, that Diſeaſes come to men for the moſt part from the power and influences of the Stars upon the bodies of men, yet not ſo ſuddenly that the ſame can preſently be perceived, like a ſtripe, or the Falling-ſickneſs. But they do encreaſe in proceſs of time by little and little as it were a diſtillation, as oyl cauſeth water to wax fat by drops falling into it.

But if it come at unequal times and hours, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will be ſeen to happen; to wit, the falling comes upon them unawares. The firſt kind, to wit, when there is a little ſhaking and ſtaggering before the fall, is mortal: But if they perceive the fall before it come, the Diſeaſe is accounted not to be ſo dangerous, but more Curable; which proceedeth not from Nature, as the firſt; nor is not common therewith, wherfore it leſs weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: The firſt brings Phrenſie, and Madneſs; but the other is a falling Diſeaſe.

And when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wound happens, dip a ſtick of wood in the blood, that it may be bloody; which being dryed, thruſt it quite into the aforeſaid Oyntment, and leave it therein; afterwards binde up the wound with a new Linen Rowler, every morning waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with the Patients own Urine; and it ſhall be healed, be it never ſo great, without any Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or Pain.
